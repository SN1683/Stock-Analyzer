    "# Predicting the price of a stock using Machine Learning Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to use a variety of past data about lots of stocks on the US New York Stock Exchange in order to be able to predict their future price. The results of this model could, for example, be combined with those of other analyses, perhaps by human analysts, to determine the investing strategy of a financial enterprise. For example, if our model predicted a price different to the actual price of a stock on the market, this could suggest that the stock is either undervalued or overvalued, and help a company cash in before a bubble bursts or jump onto a promising stock before the rest of the market realizes its potential - either way benefitting.\n"

    "This is a regression problem, so we will be testing out a few different regression ML models, and seeing which one performs the best. The idea behind this project is for the model to go over many of the metrics of the fundamental value of a stock, and from this attempt to predict what its price will be in the future. This is very much a fundamentalist approach to stock analysis - looking at various metrics about the company and trying to extrapolate from there, as opposed to ideas like momentum investing or even a chartist approach. However, in the long term, fundamentals are likely to win out over these methods, which are by their nature more short term and better for high-frequency day traders. "

This will give us a feel for the data and perhaps highlight some insights into general trends within the data. This may later help us identify if our model seems to be making peculiar predictions, as well as showing any potential outliers we might need to discard. Additionally, it's always good to have some idea of how the data works and what it looks like, so that we are not simply placing blind faith in a black box regression model and hoping its results are always right. There's 84 columns, so we obviously cannot plot them all, but it's worth exploring at least some of them."

    "This is interesting - there appears to not be a great deal of correlation - if anything a very slight negative one - between capital surplus and price. You might be surprised that a company with a large surplus would not be highly valued, but perhaps investors are disappointed that the company is not reinvesting the money and using to drive growth. This is probably an instance where an intuitive explanation is unlikely to suffice, and we should ask a financial expert if they could shine some light on this trend."

    "This is a rather sharp histogram - it seems that the vast majority of stocks are between 0 and 150 dollars, with extremely few above even 200. This is likely due to a number of factors - most retail investors not wanting to invest in comapanies whose shares are prohibitively expensive, and also the fact that this prices dataset actually takes stock splits into account, which lowers the prices of some of the more expensive companies when they decide to do a split."

    "So what we've done above is plot the share prices of all the stocks based on their net income and either profit margin or EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization). It's important to note the little 1e10 at the bottom right and top left corners - these earnings are on the order of billions. This is, however, very revealing. Net Income and EBITDA seem very strongly positively correlated, which makes sense - higher income should generally mean higher earnings. This also seems reflected in the stock price. The other graph is very interesting, and reflects the diversity of companies in the dataset. In fact, profit margin seems slightly negatively correlated with net income - perhaps as the income increases, so does the size of the company, and with it operating expenses and other costs, such that even if the absolute earnings rise, the profit margin falls.

Hence, I've decided to keep all the data we currently have. Now it is time for us to move onto training our models on this data."

From personal experience, the RandomForestRegressor model seems to perform well in general, so this is one of the models we will test. Bearing in mind we will also need to tune the hyperparameters of these models, it is perhaps unwise to test out too many, so let us narrow it down to three different models to test. To help decide on some ideas, I consulted the SciKit Learn documentation to find their machine learning models map - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html. Following this, I have decided to also test a Lasso and a RidgeRegression model."

Given that my computer has limited processing power, I will use GridSearchCV (as RandomizedSearchCV might overlook some better combinations of hyperparameters), but with a relatively limited number of hyperparameters.

Although R^2 error is commonly used, the articles I read seemed to suggest that the issue with it is that more independent variables taken into account can reduce your R^2 error, even if those variables turn out to be completely irrelevant to the result. We have quite a lot of independent variables here, and so R^2 might give spuriously good results. Hence, I have decided to use Root Mean Squared Error as my evaluation metric for this project - I will be trying to minimize it."

    "So this is very interesting to observe. Earnings Per Share is an important feature, but I did not expect it to be far and away so much more significant than everything else. It is interesting that things like profit margin and gross profit feature nowhere on this list, whereas things that might have seemed less important like the estimated shares outstanding are actually incredibly significant. This is valuable information for a financial analyst, and important to bear in mind for future projects - perhaps these attributes of the data should be given greater weightage next time."

    "So, over the course of this project, we investigated three different models for predicting stock price based on fundamental information about the stock. It transpired in the end that Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression did not work very well on this problem, and were far outcompeted by the Random Forest Regressor. Even this model was far from perfect - on average, it was about 37 dollars off the true price of the stock, which, in a market where most of the stocks are between 1 and 200 dollars, is rather high. However, we were using Root *Mean* Squared Error, so it is plausible that the model had a larger absolute error for some expensive stocks, and this distorted the average error as well. Overall, this was reasonably successful, but there are several steps we could take to improve this predictor."

    "**1. Get more data:** At the end of the day, the model was only trained on about 800 samples, which, by the standards of machine learning models, is on the small side. Especially for a commercial operation like an investment bank, it is likely there would be far more samples for our model to train on, which would hopefully significantly increase its accuracy and reduce its error."

    "**2. Tune more hyperparameters:** I was running this project on my own computer, whose processing capabilities are fairly limited. If we wanted to make this a properly deployable model, we could perhaps enlist the use of a much more powerful computer, perhaps one with a GPU, or use a Google Colab notebook. These would allow us to perform significantly more calculations, and tune many more hyperparameter combinations, hopefully ultimately resulting in a better model."

    "**3. Try out some other models:** In this project, we only tested 3 models, all of which are on the Sci Kit Learn Map. However, there are dozens, if not hundreds, of different regression models out there, and very probably some that would outperform our Random Forest on this specific problem. This would be worth investigating with the help of a finance professional, whose background would enable them to better advise us on what types of models tend to work better on financial data, or whether there are certain data parameters we should have told our model to focus on more."

   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "**4. Try to combine our model with others:** We have built one model here, but there are many approaches to analyzing stocks. It would definitely be worth trying to include elements of other analysis in our model. For example, we ignored a lot of the prices dataset, choosing only to pick the prices on the specific dates that mattered to us. However, we could have included the rest of the data too, so that our model could hopefully learn about how past prices tend to influence future ones, and how markets can move in trends and cycles. This would likely further improve our model."

    "Overall, however, this was a relatively successful project. We instantiated and tested multiple models, and came up with a model that functions somewhat well. Given the sizable constraints on processing power and training data, the model performed well, and it is likely that the slightly high RMSE is due to the errors on predicting expensive stocks skewing the average. The other thing that is important to remember is simply how unpredictable the stock market is. Even with access to nearly unlimited computing power, vast quantities of data, deep knowledge about the field and much more advanced algorithms and models, the professionals of the finance industry still have not learnt to \"beat the market\". In fact, they quite frequently get it wrong, spectacularly so on occasion. In light of this, despite its clear flaws, our model can be said to have acquitted itself well, and so I feel this project was a success."
